Sexism Identification in Social neTworks  

This project is an assignment for Natural Language Processing subject in my 3d year of DataScience Degree (Polytechnic University of Valencia)  

This is a competition between several universities in form of classification task for identifying sexism in tweets (task1) and the type of sexism in tweets (task2).  


I have upload the necessary files for the better understanding of this reposotory:
- Final Report explaining all the steps followed in this project
- Datasets:
  The training dataset has been used to train and adjust the models while the test dataset had tweets on which my final model had to be evaluated (I made     predictions on that tweets with my best model and sent the results to the competition).
- ipynb file downloaded from google collab where I trained Bert Models using Google's GPU and resources.
